# Accelerate cloud adoption with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure
Do you need a clear path forward for your cloud journey? 

This learning path includes best practice guidance to help you create a cloud strategy, define a cloud adoption plan, prepare your cloud environment with proper governance, and implement cloud operations in alignment with your organizational needs. 

# Getting-started guides
The Cloud Adoption Framework spans the entire cloud adoption lifecycle. 

Throughout that lifecycle, you can use various methodologies that are designed to help a specific role deliver a defined function.

But when you're dealing with an adoption blocker, there isn't time to mature along all of those potential roles and methodologies. 

The framework's getting-started guides pull out the actionable tasks and deliverables from each relevant methodology to help a smaller team deliver results faster.

The guides organize blockers into the following categories on the [getting-started page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/):

* Establish teams: 
	* Depending on your adoption strategy and operating model, you might need to establish a few teams. 
	* These guides help you get those new teams started or redistribute duties if a dedicated team isn't needed.

* Improve controls: 
	* As cloud adoption grows, you need a solid operating model to ensure wise decisions and proper organizational change. 
	* Align people and improve operations to develop your cloud operating model.

* Accelerate adoption:
	* Cloud adoption requires technical change, but to digitally transform with the cloud requires more than just IT. 
	* Use these guides to start aligning various teams to accelerate migration and innovation efforts.

* Align foundation: 
	* Your company's cloud is built on a set of foundational decisions that can affect all cloud-based outcomes. 
	* This guide and conceptual information can help you make core decisions and document them.
