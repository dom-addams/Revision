# Prepare for successful cloud adoption with a well-defined strategy
Success in cloud adoption depends on having a clear strategy that helps a team understand executive direction and regularly measure progress. 

This module helps you capture the cloud adoption strategy you need to drive your success.

Learning objectives:

* Create clarity for a corporate strategy to ensure that all team members are working toward common goals.
* Establish metrics to create clarity, help the team learn, and systematically work toward your organizational objectives.
* Evaluate financial considerations to understand the value of cloud adoption.
* Assess your strategy using the Cloud Adoption Strategy.
* Evaluate technical considerations to help the team prepare for successful cloud adoption projects.

## Capture strategic motivation
This unit discusses some of the motivations for cloud migration that can lead to more successful business outcomes. 

Considering common motivations can help facilitate a conversation about business drivers and, ultimately, business outcomes.

### Guiding the conversation
Digital transformation is a substantial bet for many organizations and the technology teams that lead the efforts. 

A successful digital transformation produces returns for all who are involved.

Whether they succeed or fail, digital transformation programs can define careers and the future of a business. 

Strategic clarity and executive buy-in are imperative for success. 

A clear commitment to strategic motivations drives investment allocation and helps leaders make difficult technical decisions.

Prioritizing motivations is the first step toward creating clarity in corporate strategy. 

This step helps ensure that all team members are working toward common goals, and it secures executive sponsorship to set budget, modify operations, and review results.

Most digital transformation "failures" end in technological success, but they don't deliver on the initial strategic change that's required to positively affect the business.

Ensure that technical success equates to business success by defining clear motivations and expectations with executive level leaders as early as possible.

Throughout this conversation, be prepared to engage various personas. 

The following list shows a few of the types of roles that are involved in establishing strategic vision and each persona's most common focus area:

* Finance leadership: Increase profitability while driving compliance
* Marketing: Acquire and retain customers and build reputation
* Sales: Accelerate sales and improve customer lifetime value
* Human resources: Retain, recruit, and empower employees
* Executive leadership/board of directors: Meet market growth requirements and environmental sustainability metrics

### Motivations
There are various motivations that drive cloud adoption and result in business transformations. 

In fact, it's likely that several motivations apply at the same time.

The goal of the lists in the following table is to help generate ideas about which motivations are relevant for your organization. 

From there, you can prioritize and assess the potential impacts of the motivations. 

Your cloud-adoption team should meet with executives and business leaders and use this list to understand which motivations your cloud adoption effort could affect.

Critical business events | Migration | Innovation
--- | --- | ---
Datacenter exit <br /> <br /> Merger, acquisition, or divestiture <br /> <br /> Reduction in capital expenses <br /> <br /> End of support for mission-critical technologies <br /> <br /> Response to regulatory compliance changes <br /> <br /> New data sovereignty requirements <br /> <br /> Reduction of disruptions and improvement of IT stability <br /> <br /> Reduce carbon footprint | Cost savings <br /> <br /> Reduction in vendor or technical complexity <br /> <br /> Optimization of internal operations <br /> <br /> Increase in business agility <br /> <br /> Preparation for new technical capabilities <br /> <br /> Scaling to meet market demands <br /> <br /> Scaling to meet geographic demands <br /> <br /> Integration of a complex IT portfolio | Preparation for new technical capabilities <br /> <br /> Building new technical capabilities <br /> <br /> Scaling to meet market demands <br /> <br /> Scaling to meet geographic demands <br /> <br /> Improved customer experiences and engagements <br /> <br /> Transformation of products or services <br /> <br /> Market disruption with new products or services <br /> <br /> Democratization or self-service environments

### Classify your motivations
Your motivations for cloud adoption are likely to fall into multiple categories. 

As you're building the list of motivations, you're likely to see trends emerge. 

Motivations tend to be associated more with one classification (critical business event, migration, innovation) than with others. 

Use the predominant classification to help guide the development of your cloud-adoption strategy.

When a response to critical business events is the highest priority, it's important to [get started with migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/migrate) early, often in parallel with strategy and planning efforts. 

Taking this approach requires a growth mindset and a willingness to iteratively improve processes based on direct lessons learned.

When *migration* is the highest priority, strategy and planning play a vital role early in the process. 

We recommend that you implement the first workload in parallel with your planning efforts. 

This experience helps the team understand and anticipate any learning curves that are associated with cloud adoption.

When *innovation* is the highest priority, strategy and planning require more investments early in the process. 

This approach ensures balance in the portfolio and wise alignment of the investment that's made during cloud adoption. 

For more information and guidance, see [Understand the innovation journey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/innovate).

To ensure wiser decision making, all participants in the migration process should have a clear awareness of their motivations. 

The following section outlines how leaders in the organization can influence wiser decision outcomes through consistent, strategic methodologies.

### Motivation-driven strategies
This section highlights the migration and innovation motivations and their corresponding strategies.

#### Migration
The migration motivations that are listed near the top of the motivations table are the most common reasons for adopting the cloud, but they're not necessarily the most significant reasons. 

These outcomes are important to achieve, but they're most effectively used to transition to other, more useful worldviews. 

This important first step to cloud adoption often is called a cloud migration. 

The framework uses the term migrate to refer to the strategy of executing a cloud migration.

Some motivations align well with a migration strategy. 

The motivations at the top of this list are likely to have less business impact than motivations toward the bottom of the list. 

Top migrations motivations include:

* Saving on operating costs
* Reducing vendor or technical complexity
* Optimizing internal operations
* Increasing business agility
* Preparing for new technical capabilities
* Scaling to meet market demands
* Scaling to meet geographic demands

#### Innovation
Data is the new commodity. 

Modern applications are the supply chain that drives data into various experiences. 

In today's business market, it's hard to find a transformative product or service that isn't built on top of data, insights, and customer experiences. 

The motivations that appear lower in the innovation list align to a technology strategy that's referred to as [innovate methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/innovate) in this framework.

The following list includes motivations that cause an IT organization to focus more on a strategy to innovate than on a strategy to migrate:

* Increasing business agility
* Preparing for new technical capabilities
* Building new technical capabilities
* Scaling to meet market demands
* Scaling to meet geographic demands
* Improving customer experiences and engagements
* Transforming products or services

### Cloud adoption horizons
It's common for organizations to have competing motivations. 

But competing motivations create a divide in the financial investments that the company can make in any one objective. 

Such a divide leads to an overall reduction in the amount of change or transformation that any effort can deliver.

Stratification is a sound principle in macroeconomics. 

But with the limited budget of most technology-driven change management projects, a stratified approach leads to confusing and distracting signals within the program. 

More noticeably, multiple, simultaneous investments in competing strategies lead to misalignment of the people, processes, and projects that are required for overall program success. 

For digital transformations to succeed, organizations must prioritize motivations based on timeline expectations, organizational alignment, and capacity for investment.

To create clarity and alignment, it's suggested that complex digital transformation projects align to an organization's horizons or phased program delivery. 

In this type of approach, the company commits to a single motivation category for a time-bound period. 

All teams and organizations prioritize investments and collaborate to support the priority outcome, as needed, for the defined period of time. 

This approach creates unity, clarity, and drives a snowball effect, allowing the success of one horizon to accelerate the target outcomes of the next horizon.

### Cloud adoption strategy tools
An organisation uses the [Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/?id=8fefc6d5-97ac-42b3-8e97-d82701e55bab&mode=pre-assessment) to assess its strategy posture across distinct areas of the Strategy methodology, such as:

* Identifying motivations
* Documenting expected business outcomes
* Evaluating financial considerations
* Technical considerations in creating a business case.

The Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator takes you through the categories most relevant to your organization. 

Based on your inputs for each question, it provides you with a personalized aggregate strategy score that's calculated and averaged across your uniquely identified strategy areas.

As you create your cloud adoption plan and document your strategy for stakeholder review, the Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator provides curated guidance that points to specific tools and templates. 

In addition, it provides recommendations based on principles of cloud economics and organizational alignment that provide a unified approach to build your business case.

### Record your observations
If you haven't already, download the [Cloud Adoption Framework strategy and plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/plan/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy-and-plan-template.docx). 

Under Motivations and drivers, use the motivations discussion in this unit to describe your motivations.



## Define objectives and key results
Business outcomes are how we measure strategic impact. 

Some organizations have existing key performance indicators (KPIs), which provide a measure for strategic impact. 

KPIs are a fine way to measure impact, but for organizations that don't already have operational KPIs and the rich analytics systems required to track that progress, objectives and key results (OKRs) are a more manageable approach.

This unit demonstrates how to define OKRs that can measure your strategic impact.

### Define business outcomes by using OKRs
Modern operations require modern ways to measure business outcomes, and cloud technology can help increase velocity for a business. 

An organization's measurement platform should support a company's outcomes and plan for growth by:

* Providing insights to team members and groups.
* Supporting staff to pivot quickly when outcomes don't align with strategy and expectations.
* Offering teams a structured format, templates, sequences, and tools to help them plan for and visualize increasing velocity.

### OKR overview
OKRs have proven to drive alignment in complex work environments, foster innovation, and help individuals focus on what matters. 

Many organizations have begun to use OKRs. OKRs are based on two components: an objective and key results for that objective. 

An objective is the statement of intent: what is the team trying to accomplish, and why is it important? Key results are specific outcomes that track the impact of the objective:

**Objective:** Clarity and intent

**Key results:** Measures of success within a quarter

It's important to understand that OKRs are useful for measuring team outcomes rather than individual performance. 

Because deadlines often motivate team performance, key results are established quarterly. 

OKRs help teams focus on the most important tasks instead of on the volume of work at hand. 

To focus on critical tasks, focus on what happens in a month, a quarter, and other short-term intervals. 

You can have OKRs that last longer, but shorter intervals emphasize the need for OKRs that track short-term impact.

### OKR key principles
Here are the key principles of OKRs:

* **Aspire and inspire:** Teams establish their best possible results in a given quarter, focus efforts on great outcomes, and use retrospectives to learn and iterate.
 
* **Outcome focus:** Quarterly key results provide clarity on where value is created. Being aware of where value is created helps teams and the organization drive business impacts faster.
 
* **Global and local:** Teams localize OKRs into their nouns, verbs, and numbers that enrich OKRs with the team's expertise and insights.
 
* **Transparent:** OKRs, alignment, and progress are visible to everyone through OKR software, which simplifies collaboration and supports making good decisions faster.

### How OKRs add value to an organization
OKRs help create alignment and accountability within organizations, as demonstrated in the following graph:

![GRAPH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy/media/okr.png)

### Examples of OKRs
The principles of OKRs can help your organization understand how useful OKRs take form. 

Objectives need to inspire your company and its teams to fully understand your mission. 

Key results need to be specific and measurable within a quarter.

Here are some examples of OKRs:

**Objective 1:** Be the top US provider of learning platforms to schools

Key results:

* 45 percent of K-12 schools using our platform
* A 12 percent increase in student engagement, as measured through internal systems
* A 95 percent satisfaction rate from quarterly parent surveys

**Objective 2:** Build a technology platform that supports every person in our business to innovate and create

Key results:

* Five new applications developed and adopted across the organization
* Every team with at least two members using Microsoft Power Platform
* Including new cloud technologies like data analytics and machine learning in all customer-facing applications

**Objective 3:** Transform our approach from sales driven to data driven

Key results:

* Increasing pipeline coverage from 50 percent to 200 percent
* Increasing closing rates for sales engagements by 5 percent
* Reducing the time to close deals by 8 percent


### Implement OKRs
Five steps can help your organization move forward with OKRs:

**Step 1:** Learn. Start exploring what OKRs can do for your business. Tune in to some of your industry peers and leaders to learn how OKRs have benefited their organizations.

**Step 2:** Plan. As you begin to draft your OKRs, ensure that your sponsors contribute and are involved in the process. Work with an OKR coach to refine your OKRs.

**Step 3:** Launch. Each organization launches initiatives differently. Maintain a strong communication plan, and build the OKR calibration and celebration process into your operating model.

**Step 4:** Drive. To maintain rigor and focus, make sure that you're sharing outcomes and results across the organization. Sharing results and outcomes helps your teams adopt a habit of using OKRs.

**Step 5:** Improve. Continue to improve, revisit, and rethink how you connect across the organization. OKRs in spreadsheets can be useful, but an organization can benefit most from everyone participating to meet objectives and gain insights from the aligned data.

### Anticipate financial considerations
When migrating to the cloud, it’s important to think differently about consuming and managing your cloud resources. 

As you build your business case, it’s critical to understand the key principles of cloud economics and transform your mindset. 

Part of this transformation is discovering technical and financial flexibility, efficiencies, and capabilities that aren’t possible with your on-premises IT infrastructure. 

By planning short- and long-term cloud solutions and aligning them to business outcomes, you can achieve more with every dollar you invest.



## Evaluate financial considerations
Measuring objectives and identifying the return expected from a specific objective can help you to define a financial consideration. 

Cost is another key financial consideration. 

In this unit, we explore various outcome-driven considerations, a few formulas to calculate costs, and how organizations can reduce capital expenditures.

### Understand your financial stories
A fundamental shift in the IT operating model drives The core financial benefits of Azure. 

This shift benefits your organization's core financial statements and frees up cash flow for reinvestment:

* **Balance sheet:** 
	* When you operate on-premises in datacenters, you might have invested up front in long-term assets that limit the cash and capital required to grow your business. 
	* While in the cloud, you can shift datacenter operations costs into modernization, developing cloud applications, and other projects that drive business growth. 
	* This shift can make your balance sheet more agile.

* **Cash flow statement:** 
	* The pay-for-what-you-consume model and the ability to apply policies and tags to your Azure resources can help you improve the predictability of your cash flow statement. 
	* This model improves the timing of your cash flow by delaying spend.

* **Income statement (profit and loss):** You can improve profitability over time by taking advantage of Azure's flexibility, low management costs, services, and pricing models.

### Common finance vocabulary terms
Use these common finance terms when your team is creating a cloud migration business case. 

These terms can help when you share your business case with a finance team.

### Terms
* **Amortization:** 
		* An expense tied to a typically intangible asset that reflects the economic usage of that asset in a particular time period. 
		* For example, if you purchase a license worth USD100, you'd capitalize that on your balance sheet. 
		* If you amortized it over five years, you'd annually recognize an expense of USD20 per year that impacts your income statement.

* **Balance sheet:** A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity as of a specific date.

* **Capital Expense (CAPEX):** The upfront investment in equipment. This equipment is capitalized as an asset and put on your balance sheet.

* **Cash flow statement:** A cash flow statement is a financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a company during a given period.

* **[Cloud economics](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/cloud-economics/):** An understanding of the benefits and costs of the cloud, and the financial impact when you start a migration from on-premises to cloud computing.

* **Depreciation:** 
	* An expense tied to a capitalized asset that reflects the economic usage of that asset in a particular time period. 
	* For example, if you purchase a server worth USD100, you'd capitalize that on your balance sheet. 
	* If you depreciated it over five years, you'd annually recognize an expense of USD20 per year that impacts your income statement.

* Double-mortgage period: A period when you have two sets of costs at the same time. For example, when you have both on-premises and cloud costs.

* **Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA):** 
	* A performance indicator of the profitability of a business. 
	* This metric starts from operating income, which is the income from your ongoing business operations (ignoring things like taxes or interest expense) and adds back depreciation and amortization. 
	* While a useful performance metric that's used for comparability, it's often viewed along with metrics like Capital Expenditure to have a better all-up understanding of a company's ability to generate free cash flow.

* **Net Present Value (NPV):** An assessment of the financial value of a business investment. This metric looks at cash flows, timing, and the required interest rate.

* **Operating Expense (OPEX):** The ongoing expenses for a business. For example, a maintenance payment or periodic bill for Azure services.

* **Profit and Loss (P&L):** 
	* A financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred over a specified period, usually a fiscal quarter or year. 
	* It's also referred to as the income statement.

* **Return on Investment (ROI):** 
	* Return on investment (ROI) is a metric used to understand the profitability of an investment. 
	* ROI compares how much you paid for an investment to how much you earned to evaluate its efficiency.

### Sample outcomes by category
Speaking in terms of business outcomes can feel like a foreign language to many technical-minded individuals. 

To help ease translation, we have curated a set of business outcome examples. 

You can use the following examples to inspire and demonstrate business outcomes that are based on actual transformation journeys.

To help you find specific types of examples of business outcomes, below is a list of examples split into categories. 

This approach tends to drive consensus-building conversations across business units.

**Fiscal outcomes:** Financial or fiscal performance is the cleanest business outcome for many business leaders, but it's not the only one.

**Agility outcomes:** Today's fast-changing business environment places a premium on time. The ability to respond to and drive market change quickly is the fundamental measure of business agility.

**Reach outcomes:** In a constantly shrinking market, you can measure global reach (the ability to support global customers and users) by compliance in geographies that are relevant to the business.

**Customer engagement outcomes:** Social marketplaces are redefining winners and losers at an unheard-of pace. Responding to user needs is a key measure of customer engagement.

**Performance outcomes:** Performance and reliability are assumed. When either falters, reputation damage can be painful and long-lasting.

**Sustainability goals:** Organizations are increasingly discussing environmental goals and sustainability targets.

### Create a financial model for cloud transformation
Creating a financial model that accurately represents the full business value of any cloud transformation can be complicated. 

Financial models and business justifications tend to vary for different organizations. 

This unit establishes some formulas and points out a few things that often are missed when strategists create financial models.

#### Return on investment
Return on investment (ROI) often is an important criteria for the C-suite or the board of directors. 

ROI is used to compare different ways to invest limited capital resources. 

The formula for ROI is fairly simple. The details you need to create each input to the formula might not be as simple, though. 

Essentially, ROI is the amount of return produced from an initial investment. 

ROI usually is represented as a percentage:

![IMAGE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy/media/formula-roi.png)

#### Calculate initial investment
Initial investment is the capital expense and the operating expense that's required to complete a transformation. 

Even though the classification of costs can vary depending on accounting models and CFO preference, this category includes items like professional services that are required to complete the transformation, software licenses used only during the transformation, and the cost of cloud services during the transformation. 

It can also potentially include the cost of salaried employees during the transformation.

Add these costs to create an estimate of the initial investment.

#### Calculate the gain from investment
Calculating the gain from investment often requires a second formula that's specific to the business outcomes and associated technical changes. Calculating earnings is harder than calculating cost reductions.

To calculate earnings, you need two variables:

* Changes (deltas) in revenue
* Changes in costs

![IMAGE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy/media/formula-gain-from-investment.png)

#### Revenue deltas
Revenue deltas should be forecast in partnership with business stakeholders. 

After the business stakeholders agree on a revenue impact, the agreement can be used to improve the earnings position.

#### Cost deltas
Cost deltas are the increase or decrease in costs caused by the transformation. 

Independent variables can affect cost deltas. 

Earnings largely are based on hard costs like capital expense reductions, cost avoidance, operational cost reductions, and depreciation reductions. 

The following sections describe some cost deltas to consider.

#### Depreciation reduction or acceleration
For guidance on depreciation, speak with the CFO or finance team. 

The following information is meant to serve as a general reference on the article of depreciation.

When capital is invested in the acquisition of an asset, that investment might be used for financial or tax purposes to produce ongoing benefits over the expected lifespan of the asset. 

Some companies see depreciation as a positive tax advantage. 

Others see it as a committed, ongoing expense that's similar to other recurring expenses attributed to the annual IT budget.

Speak with the finance office to find out whether eliminating depreciation is possible and whether the depreciation elimination would make a positive contribution to cost deltas.

#### Physical asset recovery
In some cases, retired assets can be sold as a source of revenue. 

This revenue often is lumped into cost reduction for simplicity. 

But selling retired assets truly can be an increase in revenue, and the revenue can be taxed. 

Speak with the finance office to understand the viability of this option and how to account for the resulting revenue.

#### Operational cost reductions
Recurring expenses that are required to operate a business often are called operating expenses. 

This category is broad. In most accounting models, this expense category includes:

* Software licensing
* Internet hosting expenses
* Electric bills
* Real estate rentals
* Cooling expenses
* Temporary staff required for operations
* Equipment rentals
* Replacement parts
* Maintenance contracts
* Repair services
* Business continuity and disaster recovery services
* Other expenses that don't require capital expense approvals

This category provides one of the highest earning deltas. 

When you're considering a cloud migration, time invested in making this list exhaustive rarely is wasted. 

Ask the CIO and finance team questions to ensure that all operational costs are accounted for.

#### Cost avoidance
When an operating expenditure is expected but not yet in an approved budget, the expenditure might not fit into a cost reduction category. 

For example, if VMware and Microsoft licenses need to be renegotiated and paid next year, they aren't fully qualified costs yet. 

Reductions in those expected costs are treated like operational costs for the sake of cost delta calculations. 

Informally, however, they should be referred to as cost avoidance until negotiation and budget approval is complete.

#### Soft-cost reductions
At some companies, soft costs like reductions in operational complexity or reductions in full-time staff for operating a datacenter might also be included in cost deltas. 

But including soft costs might not be a good idea. 

When you include soft-cost reductions, you insert an undocumented assumption that the reduction creates tangible cost savings. 

Technology projects rarely result in actual soft-cost recovery.

#### Headcount reductions
Time savings for staff often are included in soft-cost reductions. 

When those time savings map to actual reductions in IT salary or staffing, they might be calculated separately as headcount reductions.

That said, skills that are needed to work on-premises generally map to a similar (or higher-level) skill set that's needed to work in the cloud. 

So, people generally aren't laid off after a cloud migration.

An exception occurs when operational capacity is provided by a third party or an Azure Expert Managed Services Provider (MSP). 

If a third party manages IT systems, a cloud-native solution or cloud-native MSP could replace the operating costs. 

A cloud-native MSP can operate more efficiently and potentially at a lower cost. If that's the case, operational cost reductions belong in hard-cost calculations.

#### Capital expense reductions or avoidance
Capital expenses are slightly different from operating expenses. 

Generally, datacenter expansion or refresh cycles drive this category. 

A datacenter expansion example is the cost of a new high-performance cluster to host a big data solution or data warehouse. 

This expense generally would fit into a capital expense category.

More common are basic equipment refresh cycles. 

Some companies have rigid hardware refresh cycles, which means that assets are retired and replaced on a regular cycle (usually every three, five, or eight years). 

These cycles often coincide with asset lease cycles or with the forecasted life span of equipment. 

In a new refresh cycle, IT draws on capital expense to acquire new equipment.

If a refresh cycle is approved and budgeted, a cloud transformation might help eliminate that cost. 

If a refresh cycle is planned but not yet approved, the cloud transformation might avoid a capital expenditure. 

Both reductions would be added to the cost delta.

### What is cloud accounting?
The cloud changes how IT accounts for costs. 

Various IT accounting models are easier to support because of how the cloud allocates costs, so it's important to understand how to account for cloud costs before you begin a cloud-transformation journey. 

This article outlines the most common cloud accounting models for IT.

#### Traditional IT accounting (cost-center model)
It's often accurate to consider IT a cost center. 

In the traditional IT accounting model, IT consolidates purchasing power for all IT assets. 

As we pointed out in the financial models article, that purchasing power consolidation can include software licenses, recurring charges for CRM licensing, purchase of employee desktops, and other large costs.

When IT serves as a cost center, the perceived value of IT is largely viewed through a procurement-management lens. 

This perception makes it difficult for the board or other executives to understand the true value that IT provides. 

Procurement costs tend to skew the view of IT by outweighing any other value added by the organization. 

This view explains why IT is often lumped into the responsibilities of either the chief financial officer or the chief operating officer. 

This perception of IT is limited and might be shortsighted.

#### Central IT accounting (profit-center model)
To overcome the cost-center view of IT, some CIOs opted for a centralized IT model of accounting. 

In this type of model, IT is treated like a competing business unit and a peer to revenue-producing business units. 

In some cases, this model can be entirely logical. 

For example, some organizations have a professional IT services division that generates a revenue stream. 

Frequently, centralized IT models don't generate significant revenue, making it difficult to justify the model.

Regardless of the revenue model, centralized IT accounting models are unique because of how the IT unit accounts for costs. 

In a traditional IT model, the IT team records costs and pays those costs from shared funds like operations and maintenance (O&M) or a dedicated profit and loss (P&L) account.

In a central IT accounting model, the IT team marks up the services provided to account for overhead, management, and other estimated expenses. 

It then bills the competing business units for the marked-up services. In this model, the CIO is expected to manage the P&L associated with the sale of those services. 

This model can create inflated IT costs and contention between central IT and business units. 

Especially, when IT needs to cut costs or isn't meeting agreed-upon SLAs. 

During times of technology or market change, any new technology would cause a disruption to central IT's P&L, making transformation difficult.

### Chargeback
One of the common first steps in changing IT's reputation as a cost center is implementing a chargeback model of accounting. 

This model is especially common in smaller enterprises or highly efficient IT organizations. 

In the chargeback model, any IT costs that are associated with a specific business unit are treated like an operating expense in that business unit's budget. 

This practice reduces the cumulative cost effects on IT, allowing business values to show more clearly.

In a legacy on-premises model, chargeback is difficult to realize because someone still has to carry the large capital expenses and depreciation. 

The ongoing conversion from capital expenditures to operating expenses associated with usage is a difficult accounting exercise. 

This difficulty is a major reason for the creation of the traditional IT accounting model and the central IT accounting model. 

The operating-expenses model of cloud cost accounting is almost required if you want to efficiently deliver a chargeback model.

However, you shouldn't implement this model without considering the implications. 

Here are a few consequences that are unique to a chargeback model:

* Chargeback results in a massive reduction of the overall IT budget. For IT organizations that are inefficient or require extensive complex technical skills in operations or maintenance, this model can expose those expenses in an unhealthy way.

* Loss of control is a common consequence. In highly political environments, chargeback can result in loss of control and staff being reallocated to the business. This situation could create significant inefficiencies and reduce IT's ability to consistently meet SLAs or project requirements.

* Difficulty with accounting for shared services is another common consequence. If the organization is carrying technical debt as a result of growing through acquisition, it's likely that a high percentage of shared services must be maintained to keep all systems working together effectively.

Cloud transformations include solutions to these and other consequences associated with a chargeback model, but each of those solutions includes implementation and operating expenses. 

The CIO and CFO should carefully weigh the pros and cons of a chargeback model before considering one.

#### Showback or awareness-back
For larger enterprises, a showback or awareness-back model is a safer first step in the transition from cost center to value center. 

This model doesn't affect financial accounting. In fact, the P&Ls of each organization don't change. 

The biggest shift is in mindset and awareness. 

In a showback or awareness-back model, IT manages the centralized, consolidated buying power as an agent for the business. 

In reports back to the business, IT attributes any direct costs to the relevant business unit, which reduces the perceived budget directly consumed by IT. 

IT also plans budgets based on the needs of the associated business units, which allows IT to more accurately account for costs associated with purely IT initiatives.

This model provides a balance between a true chargeback model and more traditional models of IT accounting.

### Cloud accounting tools
There are several valuable tools you can use to project the costs involved in migrating to the cloud up front. 

Predicting and estimating costs provides your organization with KPIs you can later use to compare predicted versus actual costs once you’ve completed your cloud migration.

Azure Pricing Calculator: Use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to configure and estimate the costs for Azure products.

* Azure Virtual Machine (VM) Cost Estimator: 
	* The Azure VM Cost Estimator is a Power BI template that allows you to estimate your cost savings against pay-as-you-go pricing. 
	* It shows you how to optimize Azure offers and benefits for VMs, like Azure Hybrid Benefit and reserved instances. 
	* When you’re evaluating large-scale data centers of more than a hundred compute units, it can be challenging to use the web-based Azure Pricing Calculator because it requires you to input a significant number of technical criteria. 
	* The Azure VM Cost Estimator includes an Excel file that feeds data into the Power BI template. 
	* This file allows you to input a larger list of criteria, along with more technical specifications. 
	* For example, the number of cores assigned to a specific compute unit or the memory footprint and associated utilization. 
	* You can even specify the currency value you want the price list generated in, and the different Azure targets you want to place your workloads in. 
	* In that way, the Azure VM Cost Estimator helps you automate the cloud cost estimation process.

### Impact of cloud accounting models
The choice of accounting models is crucial in system design. 

The choice of accounting model can affect subscription strategies, naming standards, tagging standards, and policy and blueprint designs.

After you've worked with the business to make decisions about a cloud accounting model and [global markets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/global-markets), you can learn more about how to [achieve more with your investment in the cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/achieve-more).



## Understand technical considerations
To prepare for executing your digital-transformation strategy, it's important to understand the technical considerations that drive the implementation of the strategy. 

This unit helps you evaluate those technical considerations through the selection and completion of your first technical project.

### How does cloud pricing work?
Cloud costs are tied to compute and storage and include the underlying software licensing fees. 

The cloud uses a pay-for-what-you-consume model versus the up-front server infrastructure and software licensing costs that you would typically pay on-premises in your data center. 

On-premises, you typically have a combination of upfront costs and operating expenditures. 

When you move to the cloud, you shift to the pay-as-you-consume model and mainly operating expenditures.

To take advantage of the best pricing in the cloud, you must understand how you consume resources for your specific workloads. 

Once you have a consumption plan, you can establish your fixed- and variable-cost models to maximize your investment.

### Understand your workloads
On-premises, your architecture is typically provisioned for peak capacity. 

Migrating from on-premises to the cloud gives you the flexibility of scalability, and you can scale up and down as needed. 

It’s critical to understand your workloads to realize the full benefits of the cloud.

* **Idle capacity:** 
	* Azure helps eliminate the idle capacity created by overprovisioned architecture for coverage during peak usage. 
	* Rightsizing and eliminating workloads you don’t need helps reduce your idle capacity when moving to the cloud. 
	* This exercise delivers immediate savings and cash flow reductions.

* **Unpredictable workloads:** 
	* You can scale your compute resources up and down in the cloud as the demands of your business change. 
	* You're able to scale your capacity up and down and use a variable-cost model as opposed to a fixed-cost model. 
	* This elasticity of the cloud makes the pay-for-what-you-consume model possible and works well for your unpredictable workloads. 
	* Consider using virtual machine scale sets and snoozing VMs to only pay for the resources you need when you need them.

* **Predictable workloads:** For your predictable workloads, you can take advantage of the cost-savings offers such as Azure Reservations.

* **Initial clean-up, right-sizing, and optimization:** 
	* When planning to move to Azure, review which workloads are no longer needed. 
	* This process of cleanup can help you build a stronger business case and show an immediate effect on your budgets. 
	* For workloads you still want to use and bring to the cloud, you can use tools to help optimize them, like Azure Migrate.


### Take advantage of cost-savings offers
Cloud billing models and offers differ from on-premises, and they can create meaningful savings opportunities for you to reduce cloud costs. 

Saved costs from cloud adoption can be reinvested into iterative modernization. 

Cloud costs are flexible and can be reduced with:

* Azure Hybrid Benefit: 
	* Reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud by using this licensing benefit. 
	* You can use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure. 
	* This benefit applies to RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions, too. 

* Azure Spot Virtual Machines: 
	* You can use Spot Virtual Machines with deep discounts for workloads that can be interrupted and don't need to complete within a specific time frame. 
	* For example, high-performance computing scenarios, batch processing jobs, or visual rendering applications. 
	* Also, dev and test environments, including continuous integration and continuous delivery workloads, or large-scale stateless applications. 

* Reservations: 
	* Receive a discount on your workloads when you reserve your resources in advance. 
	* In return, Microsoft passes the savings on to you as discounts of up to 72 percent. 

* Azure Dev/Test pricing: 
	* Take advantage of discounted rates for your development and testing. 
	* Including, the Microsoft software charges on Azure Virtual Machines and special dev and test pricing on other services. 

* Extended security updates: 
	* Receive continued support in the cloud for SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 that have reached the end of their support lifecycle. 
	* You can migrate your on-premises SQL Server instances to Azure Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Database, or stay on-premises and purchase extended security updates. 
	* You receive free extended security patches by migrating to an Azure Virtual Machine.

### Achieve more with your investment
The goal of your cloud business case is to achieve more with every dollar invested. 

You can accomplish this goal by releasing committed cash flows and budgets that can be reinvested into further modernization. 

This concept is the velocity of the dollar; you accelerate value per dollar through phased reinvestment driving modernization and value.

The initial technical benefits of a cloud migration focus on the lift and shift model, where you migrate workloads to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in the cloud. 

The goal is to get the most out of your on-premises investment, then move those workloads to IaaS, potentially freeing up cash flow. 

Historically, this process would be considered a savings opportunity. 

This approach in the cloud is better viewed as a reinvestment opportunity.

As you free up cash flow, continue your cloud adoption, and mature your workloads, you can reinvest the savings to modernize to different service levels. 

Once you have your initial workloads in IaaS, you might consider shifting some workloads to platform-as-a-service (PaaS). 

You can still provide the same type of service delivery; however, you deliver it at a lower cost with more features and functionality. 

The next step in the iterative modernization process is moving some workflows and line-of-business applications to software-as-a-service (SaaS).

By planning your phases of cloud maturity and the reinvestment of your cloud savings, and aligning with [business outcomes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes), you can achieve more with every dollar you invest.


### Hands-on evaluation of technical considerations during your first project
There's a learning curve and a time commitment associated with cloud adoption planning. 

Even for experienced teams, proper planning takes time. 

Time to align stakeholders, to collect and analyze data, to validate long-term decisions, and to align people, processes, and technology. 

In the most productive adoption efforts, planning grows in parallel with adoption, improving with each release and with each workload migration to the cloud. 

It's important to understand the difference between a cloud adoption plan and a cloud adoption strategy. 

You need a well-defined strategy to facilitate and guide the implementation of a cloud adoption plan.

Beginning a first adoption process in parallel with developing the plan provides the following benefits:

* Establishes a growth mindset to encourage learning and exploration
* Provides an opportunity for the team to develop necessary skills
* Creates situations that encourage new approaches to collaboration
* Identifies skill gaps and potential partnership needs
* Provides tangible inputs to the plan

### First-project criteria
Your first adoption project should align with your motivations and any defined adoption horizons. 

Whenever possible, your first project should also demonstrate progress toward a defined business outcome.

### First-project expectations
Your team's first adoption project is likely to result in a production deployment of some kind, but it isn't always the case. 

Establish proper expectations early. Here are a few wise expectations to set for the first project:

* The project is a source of learning.
* The project might result in production deployments, but it's likely to require more effort first.
* The output of the project is a set of clear requirements to provide a longer-term production solution.

### First-project examples
To support the preceding criteria, this list provides an example of a first project for each motivation category:

* Critical business events: 
	* When a critical business event is the primary motivation, implementing a tool like Azure Site Recovery might be a good first project. 
	* During migration, you would use a tool like Azure Migrate to quickly migrate a few low-impact datacenter assets. 
	* But during the first project, you might also first use Site Recovery as a disaster recovery tool. 
	* You would be reducing dependencies on disaster recovery assets within the datacenter before pragmatically planning the migration.

* Migration motivations: 
	* When migration is the primary motivation, it's wise to start with the migration of a noncritical workload. 
	* The next module in this learning path, Migrate to Azure through repeatable processes and common tools, teaches the team how to deliver that type of project.

* Innovation motivations: 
	* When innovation is the primary motivation, the creation of a targeted dev/test environment can be a great first project.

#### Here are other examples of first adoption projects:

* BCDR: Beyond Site Recovery, you can implement multiple BCDR strategies as a first project.
* Nonproduction: Deploy a nonproduction instance of a workload.
* Archive: Cold storage can place a strain on datacenter resources. Moving that data to the cloud is a solid quick win.
* End of support (EOS): Migrating assets that have reached EOS is another quick win that builds technical skills. It also might provide some cost avoidance from expensive support contracts or licensing costs.
* Virtual desktop interface: Creating virtual desktops for remote employees can provide a quick win. In some cases, this first adoption project might also reduce dependence on expensive private networks in favor of commodity public internet connectivity.
* Dev/test: Remove dev/test from on-premises environments to give developers control, agility, and self-service capacity.
* Basic applications (fewer than five): Modernize and migrate a basic application to quickly gain developer and operations experience.
* Performance labs: When you need high-scale performance in a lab setting, use the cloud to quickly and cost-effectively provision those labs for a short time.
* Data platform: Create a data lake that has scalable compute for analytics, reporting, or machine learning workloads, and migrate to managed databases by using dump/restore methods or data migration services.


### Align your partner strategy
The Cloud Adoption Framework approaches cloud adoption as a self-service activity. 

The objective is to empower each of the teams supporting adoption through standardized approaches. 

In practice, however, you can't assume that a self-service approach is sufficient for all adoption activities.

Successful cloud-adoption programs typically involve at least one level of support. 

Some cloud-adoption efforts might require support from multiple partners working together toward a common goal.

### Steps to align the partnership strategy
It's important to start aligning your partnership strategy while strategizing adoption. The following steps can help remove roadblocks in later phases of the adoption lifecycle.

* Start to understand support needs
* Consider partnership options that fit your culture and needs
* Evaluate a shortlist of partner options
* Begin contract and paperwork reviews with selected partners

Completing these steps early helps ensure success of the team when the technical efforts begin. 

### Understand support needs
Throughout the cloud adoption lifecycle, various teams might require support to be successful. 

The following are a few examples of the types of help commonly required.

* **Strategy:** Support defining the business strategy, building a business case, and supporting technology strategy
* **Plan:** Support with discovery of the portfolio, quantitative assessment of the digital estate, development of a cloud adoption plan, and the creation of a skilling plan
* **Ready:** Support deploying a landing zone or full cloud environment capable of supporting the cloud adoption plan
* **Migrate:** Assistance migrating workloads or building a migration factory to ensure sound migration processes
* **Innovate:** Assistance developing new solutions or rebuilding/rearchitecting existing solutions to drive innovation
* **Govern:** Support or ongoing managed services to provide governance and controls across the cloud environment
* **Manage:** Support or ongoing managed services to operate the cloud platform and the workloads hosted in the cloud

Few corporations have the diversity of skills required to support strategy, planning, readiness, adoption, governance, and management. 

Partners and other support models are often necessary to fill in the gaps in the team's skills and responsibilities.

Various partnership options can help develop needed skills, augment staffing requirements, or completely offload specific processes.

### Partnership options
There are several options to support your team throughout your cloud adoption journey.

* **Azure solution providers (partners):** Get connected with Azure Expert Managed Services Providers (MSPs) and other Microsoft partners who have service offerings aligned to the Cloud Adoption Framework methodologies
* **FastTrack for Azure:** Use the Microsoft FastTrack for Azure program to accelerate migration
* **Azure Migration Program:** The Azure Migration Program aligns a mixture of partners and Microsoft employees to accelerate and support your migration
* **Solution assessments:** Get assistance from a Microsoft Solution Assessment expert or qualified partner as part of a Solution Assessment engagement


### Azure solution providers

If your support request requires deep technical guidance, visit [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans) to align the best plan for your needs.

### Shortlist of partner options
During strategy development, it's hard to define specific partnership needs. 

During development of the cloud adoption plan and skilling plan, those needs come into focus.

But, based on the culture and maturity of your team, it might be possible to decide on a partnership option that is more aligned with your expected needs.

Choose one or more of these partnership options to narrow down the options to investigate first.

### Begin contract and paperwork reviews
As the shortlist of options is reviewed, there's likely to be one or more partners that stand out. 

If there's a clear leader among the partners, start the process to review contracts and paperwork with the partner.

The contracting process can take time. Reviewing legal terms ahead of time can remove one barrier to engagement when your teams need help the most. 

Especially, if your company requires vendors to be added to an approved vendor list.



## Create a business case
### What is a business case?
Your organization depends on information technology (IT) for its operations, and probably for creating and supplying its products as well. 

It's a significant expense. For these reasons, a move to the cloud must be carefully considered and planned.

A business case provides a view of the technical and financial timeline of your environment, and can represent the opportunities for reinvestment into further modernization. 

Developing a business case includes building a financial plan that takes technical considerations into account and aligns with [business outcomes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes). 

It helps you foster support from your Finance team and other areas of the business, helps accelerate cloud migration, and enables business [agility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/agility-outcomes).

### Key components of a business case
When you're planning your business case to migrate to the cloud, there are several key components to consider.

* **Environment scope, technical and financial:** 
	* As you build out the on-premises view of your environment, think about how your environment scope, from both a technical and financial perspective, is aligned. 
	* You want to be sure the technical environment you're using for your plan matches up to the financial data.

* **Baseline financial data: Cost to run today:** 
	* When you build out your business case, it’s important to pull your baseline financial data. 
	* Common questions you can ask to gather the financial data needed are:
		* How much does it cost to run my environment today?
		* What am I spending on servers in an average year? 
		* What am I spending in my data center operations categories, for example, power or lease costs?
		* When is the next hardware refresh?
 
* **Projections:** On-premises costs in on-premises scenario: Forecast what your on-premises costs are if you don’t migrate to the cloud.

* **Projections:** 
	* On-premises costs in Azure scenario: Forecast what your on-premises costs are if you migrate to the cloud in an Azure scenario. 
	* It takes resources and time to shift your environment to the cloud, so it’s important to account for them in the business case. 
	* When you build out the Azure scenario, be sure to take into consideration and include all of the core benefits the cloud provides.

* **Projections: Migration timeline and Azure costs (optimized):** 
	* Project what the migration timeline and Azure costs are with a given environment. 
	* Consider how you can optimize and get the most out of your Azure investment. 
	* For example, use reserved instances, scale capacity up and down, use the Azure hybrid benefit, and right-size your resources.

A business case isn't just a point-in-time view. 

It’s a plan for a time period. As you shift to the cloud, you reduce your spend over-time and create a cloud migration plan. 

You can model out what the ramp-down in spend will be on-premises over time associated with your cloud migration plan.

Once you've identified on-premises workloads and cost structure, you can then build out your optimized Azure consumption plan.

As a final step, when you create your business case, you want to compare the cloud environment to an on-premises or status quo scenario. 

You can take your Azure view and compare it to your on-premises or status quo scenario with no migration so you can assess the benefit of migrating to the cloud. 

The Azure view will show on-premises costs that are being reduced over time, your Azure environment costs, and any migration costs associated with shifting to a cloud environment.


### Tools for preparing a business case
Azure offers a range of valuable tools and calculators to help you prepare a business case for your cloud migration.

**Azure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator:** Use the TCO Calculator online tool to estimate the cost savings you can realize when you migrate your workloads to Azure.

Enter details of your on-premises infrastructure into the tool including servers, databases, storage, and networking, licensing assumptions, and costs.

The Calculator creates a match from Azure Services to create a high-level initial TCO comparison. 

However, the results of the TCO Calculator need to be considered with care, since an on-premises server list is often complex, and optimization steps can be taken when considering Azure.

**Retail Rates Prices API:** Use the Retail Rates Prices API to retrieve retail prices for all Azure services. 

Previously, the only way to retrieve prices for Azure services was to either use the Azure Pricing Calculator or use the Azure portal. 

This API gives you an unauthenticated experience to get retail rates for all Azure services. 

Use the API to explore prices for Azure services against different regions and different SKUs. 

The programmatic API can also help you create your own tools for internal analysis and price comparison across SKUs and regions. 

**Azure Pricing calculator:** Use the [Azure Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to configure and estimate the costs for Azure products.

**Partner toolsets:** Microsoft Partners have access to tools in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/home) that can help create a migration cost analysis.

**Solution assessments:** Get assistance from a Microsoft Solution Assessment expert or qualified partner as part of a [Solution Assessment engagement](https://www.microsoft.com/solutionassessments/).

**Azure Migration Program:** Join the Azure Migration Program to get the guidance and expert help you need at every stage of the cloud migration journey. Migrate infrastructure, databases, and apps, and move forward with confidence.
